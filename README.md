The contents of this Repository are Cacti 1.2.21++ compatible Device Packages originally
maintained by Percona many years ago.  These Cacti Packages have not been enhanced in any
way.  Many require that the Cacti Data Collector user account have transparent SSH
into the servers to be monitored.  Scalability is not guaranteed using these packages.
However, people over the years have been asking for arhive copies of them.  So, here
they are.
